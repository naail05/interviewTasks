Numbers-- print consecutive numbers
write a function:
That, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a number is divisible by more than one numbers: 2, 3 or 5 it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replaced by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all the three numbers 2, 3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.
