/**
 Numbers divisible by 3, 5 and 15:
 Write a program that can print the numbers between 1~ 100 that can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15.
 * if the numbers can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15 then it should only be displayed in DivisibleBy15 section
 *  if the numbers can be divisible by 3, but can not be divisible by 15 then it should only be displayed in DivisibleBy3 section
 *   if the numbers can be divisible by 5, but can not be divisible by 15 then it should only be displayed in DivisibleBy5 section

 ex:
 output:
 Divisible by 15 15 30 45 60 75 90
 Divisible by 5 5 10 20 25 35 40 50 55 65 70 80 100
 Divisible by 3 3 6 9 12 18 21 24 27 33 36 39 42 48 51 54 57 63 66 69 72 78 81 84 87 93 96 99
